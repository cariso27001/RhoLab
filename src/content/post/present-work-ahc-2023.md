The 4th Asian Horticultural Congress is about to start in Tokyo from Aug. 28 â€“ Aug. 31. Here we Rho Lab is ready to present our latest research findings of the temperature effect on lettuce (*Lactuca sativa* L.) physiological changes. Furthermore, crop model built with Cropbox was utilized in the research to simulate the dry mass changes throughout the experiment period. We are excited that our work is going to be published in the international event.
